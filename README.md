# Audio to text to audio multi-modal chat

This is a multi-modal chatbot that focuses on transcribing audio, coupled with the optional text </br>
which are processed together to generate an output, both in audio (speech) and text format. </br>

I have used various pre-trained models available on Huggingface, and used Google Colab's resources </br> to run them.
